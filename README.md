# Competitive-Programming

Repository for my competitive-programming journey.

## Structure:

### algo/:
The ```algo``` directory contains the cpp template, debugging header, stress testing template and the various code snippets that I commonly use during any contest.

### scripts/
The ```scripts``` directory contains the bash and python scripts that I have written to create a cpp programming and testing system that handles the competivive programming process end-to-end.

The various bash scripts, and their description, can be obtained via the list_scripts script in the ```scripts/bash/``` directory:

```
% ./list_scripts
List of all scripts:
COMMAND              : Description
cpr                  : Compiles and runs a cpp file
sfile                : Copies the template cpp file over to current location with given name
stest                : Setups testing system for a particular file
rtest                : Runs tests after setting up the testing system
sedit                : Edits the template cpp file
debug_edit           : Edits the debug header file
publish_debug_header : Copies over the debug header file so that the compiler can find it
list_snippets        : Lists all snippets
list_scripts         : Lists all scripts

For further information on how to run any given script, run the script with -h or --help option
```

To use these scripts properly and from any directory, one would need to add the absolute path of ```scripts/bash``` directory to their PATH variable.

### contests/
The ```contests``` directory contains my forays into competitive programming on various platforms that hold regular programming contests. Mostly, I compete on ```codeforces.com```, ```atcoder.jp```, ```codechef.com``` and ```leetcode.com```. The ```leetcode``` solutions aren't here though as it has it's own ide that, like ```topcoder```, only accepts solution via class method definitions that it runs to test the solution.


### competitions/
The ```competitions``` directory contains my codes of competitive programming competitions in which I have participated.
