# To Do List:

## Snippets:
* Write Modular Int class.
* Rolling Hash (allowing for handling of multiple bases and primes simultaneously).
* Either use AtCoder's lib or write your own generic Segtree implementation.

## Scripts:
### rtest:
* Incorporate tletest
* Allow rtest to copy over test cases or at least run bruteforce on test cases stored for the stress tester source.
* Simplify rtest -e against checker
### sfile:
* Allow for option of TEST1
* Allow for creation of topcoder style template
### helper.sh:
* Actually add helper functions to helper.sh
### list_scripts
* Fix list_scripts
### cpr:
* Create the option to overwrite the correct answer of a test case.
* Create the option to split after the test cases and save them
* cpr -g bug. When 5 test files and 4th deleted and new one saved, 5th one overwritten.
### Overall:
* Write a script for setting up the script system
* Write a script for testing the entire script system
* Write an editor script

## Topics:
* Manacher's Algo (problem : ??)
* Z Algo
* Tarjan's Algo for articulation / cut points and bridges (cut edges).

## Refer Solution:
* Get count of smaller nodes in the subtree for every node (problem: [Insomnia 2k24 finals problem I](https://codeforces.com/gym/510369/problem/I))
