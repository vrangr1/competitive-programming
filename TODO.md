# TODO:

## Snippets:
* Rolling Hash (allowing for handling of multiple bases and primes simultaneously).
* Either use AtCoder's lib or write your own generic Segtree implementation.

## Scripts:
* Incorporate tletest into rtest
* Allow rtest to copy over test cases or at least run bruteforce on test cases stored for the stress tester source.
* Actually add helper functions to helper.sh
